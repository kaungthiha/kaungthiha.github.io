### I'm Kaung Thiha (á€€á€±á€¬á€„á€ºá€¸á€žá€®á€Ÿ) but please call me Kaung.

I graduated from USF- the University of San Francisco _not_ the University of South Florida like Google seems to think - studying Business Analytics & Computer Science.

I spent my formative years in Myanmar thinking I'd be a writer or Jimmy Neutron. Half-fittingly, I was initially an English + Philsophy major with law school aspirations. The latter is on the backburner for now (+3 years give or take) but the former still bleeds into my interests and writing style from time to time.

Nowadays, I like playing around with data to solve cool problems. I've got a solid understanding of Python and Java + am pretty handy with SQL, R and Tableau. Been trying to understand the data engineering side of things a bit more as well (Shoutout to Zach Wilson who is putting out some awesome stuff!!)  Sadly, I'm still not as cool as Jimmy Neutron yet- I could not pull off the cowlick hairstyle ðŸ˜­. 

I'll be using this as a way to showcase my projects beyond a repo or LinkedIn. It is a little barebones right now but I'm hoping to change that as I reformat old projects and work on new ones, all while improving my technical chops.
