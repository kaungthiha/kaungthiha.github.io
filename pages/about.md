## I'm Kaung Thiha (á€€á€±á€¬á€„á€ºá€¸á€žá€®á€Ÿ) but please call me Kaung.

I graduated from USF- the University of San Francisco _not_ the University of South Florida ðŸ˜­ - studying Business Analytics & Computer Science.

I spent my formative years in Myanmar thinking I'd be a writer or Jimmy Neutron. Half-fittingly, I was initially an English and Philsophy major with law school aspirations. The latter is on the backburner for now (+3 years give or take) but the former still bleeds into my interests and code commenting style from time to time.
Nowadays, I like playing around with data to solve cool problems and pretending I'm not an LLM merchant when I'm coding. So more than Jimmy than Neutron, I suppose. 

I'll be using this as a way to showcase my projects beyond a repo or LinkedIn. It is a little barebones right now but I'm hoping to change that as I reformat old projects and work on new ones, all while improving my technical chops.
